"""
Consistent Bayesian formulation and solution for posing 
and solving stochastic inverse problems.

sample :mod:`cbayes.sample` provides data structures to store sets 
of samples and formulate inverse problems.

solve :mod:`cbayes.solve` provides various methods for solving the 
stochastic inverse problem, including accept/reject, MCMC (to add), 
and surrogate posteriors (to add).

postProcess :mod:`cbayes.postProcess` provides several plotting utilities, 
sorting tools, metrics, and other functionality once the posterior is computed.

distributions :mod:`cbayes.distributions` provides methods for handling 
parameteric distributions
